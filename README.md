# Chip-8 emulator written in Common Lisp.

Why not, right?

Well, I did a thing. I'm sorry for putting all this in a single commit,
I know it isn't good practice, but I promise I'll do better from now on.

Binary distributions coming soon, possibly after I'm done testing this thing
thoroughly to make sure no bugs are left over.

Also code is not tested very well - but from a few simple tests I've done,
it seems to be working pretty fine. Some games may not work.

SCHIP compatability is not there yet - only original chip8 is supported.
